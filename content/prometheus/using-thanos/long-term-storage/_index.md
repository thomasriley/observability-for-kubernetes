## Long Term Storage 

Now that you have enabled high availability with Prometheus using Thanos you can look at the next killer feature of Thanos, long term storage of metrics!

To enable this, you first need to create a bucket on an object store such as AWS S3 or GCP Storage. Next you enable the Thanos Sidecar to upload metrics to the object store. Lastly, you need to deploy another Thanos component called Store that acts as an API for the metrics available in the object store and will be queried by the existing Thanos Query instance when a user executes a Prometheus query via Thanos Query. The diagram below shows this using a GCP Storage bucket.

![Thanos With Long Term Storage](/prometheus/using-thanos/long-term-storage/images/long-term-storage.png?classes=shadow&width=40pc)

From the perspective of users they are completely unaware that when they execute a Prometheus query Thanos is querying the for metrics from both the Prometheus instances and from the object storage.

How does this work? Prometheus stores metrics in **blocks**. Initially, it stores a block in memory however periodically, typically every 2 hours, it writes the current in memory block out to the filesystem. As the Thanos Sidecar in the Prometheus Pod has the same shared filesystem as the Prometheus container it can see the new block that Prometheus writes to the filesystem. Once it sees a new block on disk, the Thanos Sidecar uploads the block to the object storage as per its configuration. This is shown below in the diagram.

![Thanos Sidecar Upload](/prometheus/using-thanos/long-term-storage/images/thanos-sidecar-upload.png?classes=shadow&width=40pc)

Lets now implement this. For this example I created a Google Cloud Storage bucket called **observability-for-kubernetes-thanos-demo** and provisioned a Service Account with 'Storage Admin' permissions so that Thanos can read and write to the storage bucket. In the cloud provider of your choice, create a storage bucket and set of credentials with permission to access the bucket.

We you need to create a Thanos Object Store configuration file that provides the bucket configuration and credentials to Thanos. The structure of this file differs per cloud provider, you can see the [Thanos Documenation](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos/blob/master/docs/storage.md) to see the different options but for this example lets  proceed using Google Cloud Platform.

You will create a Kubernetes Secret that contains the GCP Service Account and Bucket Name. The example below shows the expected structure, however the GCP Service Account is not valid for obvious security reasons!

```yaml
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: "observability-for-kubernetes-thanos-demo"
  service_account: |-
  {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "kubernetes-cloud-lab",
    "private_key_id": "",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "observability-for-kubernetes@kubernetes-cloud-lab.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/observability-for-kubernetes%40kubernetes-cloud-lab.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  }
```

You should take the valid version of the example above and base64 encode it. You can use `base64` in your terminal for doing this. Then create a file called **thanos-object-secret.yaml** and include the Kubernetes Secret, as shown below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: thanos-config
  namespace: prometheus
data:
  thanos.config: 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
```

The value of **thanos.config** should be set to the base64 string that was just generated.

Apply **thanos-object-secret.yaml** to Kubernetes by executing `kubectl apply -f thanos-object-secret.yaml`:

```shell
$kubectl apply -f thanos-object-secret.yaml
secret/cluster-thanos-config created
```

With the object store configuration deployed to Kubernetes, next update the Prometheus resource adding the **objectStorageConfig** key so that the Prometheus Operator configures the Thanos Sidecar with the object storage config that has just been deployed to Kubernetes.

The Prometheus resource should look similar to the below with this added:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:

  namespace: prometheus

              values:

        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 10Gi
  version: v2.44.0
```

Edit the **prometheus.yaml** file you created previously to reflect the changes above. Under the **objectStorageConfig** key set the **name** to be the name of the Kubernetes Secret you just created and the **key** to be the name of the secret key you used, which in this case is **thanos.config**.

Apply the updated **prometheus.yaml** to Kubernetes by running `kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml`. To see an example of the full YAML file that reflects the changes described above see [here](/prometheus/using-thanos/long-term-storage/static/thanos-with-object-config.yaml).

Once the Prometheus Pods have restarted with the new configuration, use `kubectl logs` to view the logs from the **thanos-sidecar** container in one of the Prometheus Pods, as shown below:

```shell
$kubectl logs prometheus-prometheus-0 thanos-sidecar --namespace prometheus

```

If your instances of Prometheus have been running long enough (atleast 2 hours) there should be a block on the filesystem ready to be uploaded. If there is, you will see it upload the block to the storage bucket as shown above. See the log entry **"upload new block"** where it begins the upload. If you check the bucket in the cloud provider console you will the blocks are now present.

## Thanos Components

Now that the Thanos Sidecar is uploading blocks to the object store, we need to deploy two addtional components: Thanos Store and Thanos Compact.

### Thanos Store

Thanos Store acts as an API for querying Prometheus metrics stored in the object store.

Update **prometheus.yaml** to also include the following:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: thanos-store
  namespace: prometheus
  labels:
    app: thanos-store
    thanos-store-api: "true"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  serviceName: thanos-store
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: thanos-store
      thanos-store-api: "true"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: thanos-store
        thanos-store-api: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: thanos-store
        image: improbable/thanos:v0.5.0
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 1Gi
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1Gi
        args:
        - "store"
        - "--data-dir=/prometheus/cache"
        - "--objstore.config-file=/config/thanos.config"
        - "--log.level=info"
        - "--index-cache-size=256MB"
        - "--chunk-pool-size=256MB"
        - "--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency=30"
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 10902
        - name: grpc
          containerPort: 10901
        - name: cluster
          containerPort: 10900
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /prometheus
          name:  thanos-store-storage
        - mountPath: /config/
          name: thanos-config
      volumes:
      - name: thanos-config
        secret:
          secretName: thanos-config
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: thanos-store-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```

Apply this to Kubernetes by running `kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml`.

Kubernetes will launch a single Thanos Store Pod as per the configuration above. If you check the available **Stores** in the Thanos Query UI, you will now see Thanos Store listed in addition to the two Thanos Sidecars running alongside Prometheus. Now when querying via Thanos Query, the query will execute across both the Prometheus instances and also the metrics stored in the object store!

![Thanos Query Stores](/prometheus/using-thanos/long-term-storage/images/thanos-query-with-store.png?classes=shadow&width=40pc)

### Thanos Compact

Thanos Compact is the final Thanos component you need to deploy. 

Compact performs three main tasks:

* It executes a Prometheus compaction job on the blocks in the object store. Typically Prometheus would execute this for blocks locally on the filesystem but the process is disabled by Prometheus Operator when using Thanos.
* It also executes a down-sampling process on metrics in the object store. Prometheus stores metrics with a resolution of 1 minute. However, if you were to execute a query over a period of months or years on a Prometheus environment using Thanos with long term storage, the number of data-points returned would be excessive! Therefore, Compact performs the down-sampling job adding a 5 minute and 1 hour sample in addition to the 1 minute sample. It does this by creating a new block and discarding the original once down-sampling is completed. When executing queries, Thanos will automatically select the most appropriate sample to return.
* Lastly, it is also possible to set retention periods for the 1 minute, 5 minute and 1 hour samples. Compact will apply these retentions if they are set.

Now lets deploy Thanos Compact. 

Update **prometheus.yaml** to also include the following:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: thanos-compact
  namespace: prometheus
  labels:
    app: thanos-compact
spec:
  replicas: 1
  serviceName: thanos-compact
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: thanos-compact
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: thanos-compact
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: thanos-compact
        image: improbable/thanos:v0.5.0
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 1Gi
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1Gi
        args:
        - "compact"
        - "--data-dir=/prometheus/compact"
        - "--objstore.config-file=/config/thanos.config"
        - "--log.level=info"
        - "--retention.resolution-raw=2d"
        - "--retention.resolution-5m=5d"
        - "--retention.resolution-1h=10d"
        - "--consistency-delay=15m"
        - "--wait"
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 10902
        - name: grpc
          containerPort: 10901
        - name: cluster
          containerPort: 10900
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /prometheus
          name: thanos-compact-storage
        - mountPath: /config/
          name: thanos-config
      volumes:
      - name: thanos-config
        secret:
          secretName: thanos-config
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: thanos-compact-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```

Apply this to Kubernetes by running `kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml`.

Kubernetes will launch a single Thanos Compact Pod which will, once running, start performing the actions described above on blocks stored in the object store.

To see an example of the full YAML file that reflects the changes described above with Thanos Store and Compact see [here](/prometheus/using-thanos/long-term-storage/static/thanos-with-components.yaml).
